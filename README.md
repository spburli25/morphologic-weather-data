# Morphologic Interview Tasks

This repo contains a simple app written in html + javascript. The purpose of the app is to fetch a 7 day weather forecast for a set of locations.

We'd like you to complete the following tasks by 9am on Thursday the 31st August. You are welcome to use the internet to find any documentation you think you require, but avoid importing any other external scripts or styles beyond what is already provided.

## Task 1

A bug has been introduced that's preventing the content from loading, can you identify the issue and fix it?

## Task 2

Currently the date tabs are non-functional. We'd like users to be able to click on the tab to show data for the corresponding day.

- Clicking a tab should apply the active class to the selected tab
- The active class should be removed from any non selected tabs
- The table contents should be updated to display the correct hourly data for the selected day

## Task 3

There is no feedback to the user when they have selected a location until the data is rendered. We'd like to let them know their input is being processed by displaying a loading spinner.

- While any api requests are being made display a loading spinner in place of the main content
- Should be removed when the request is finished
- Correct data should be displayed on request complete

## Task 4

There has been a request from ours users that we display precipitation data in addition to temperature. We'd like you to fetch this data and display it in a new row of the table.

- Should update the api call to fetch precipitation data as well as temperature data
- Should be displayed in a new row in the table alongside temperature

## Task 5

Our users would like to customise their weather metric view.

- Pick at least 5 metrics from the open-meteo api
- Display these as checkboxes in a row under the location select box
- Refetch the table data as needed to get the selected metrics
